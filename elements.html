									<h3>Cyber security competition</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/club.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having been appointed Cyber Security President. One of our club activities consisted of participating in a competition. We had to protect our infrastructure to make sure that we don't get attacked. Learning our vulnerabilities, patching and blocking from attack as a team. Game day we didn't have any information about what we were going to protect. We had to make sure that all of the bases were covered when they opened up. We had about five servers and different desktops computers that we had to work as a team and protect. This was so much fun and a great learning experience. </p>
									<br></br>

									<h3>Camera configuration</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cameras2.jpg" alt="" /></span>As a company, we had offices all over Utah, Nevada, and Colorado. Installing cameras in all the locations was something that the IT department had to install and configure. This was a daily task with all locations having cameras up and running at all times. Since children were involved we had to make sure they worked in case we had an incident on site. Creating Vlans and making sure that we had IPs assigned to all cameras. I had also make sure that all firmware was updated. </p>
									
									<br></br>
									<h3>relocating Wires</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/relocate.jpg" alt="" /></span>I made a point to visit all locations in Utah and get all their network needs met. As you can see this particular office had some networking issues. This office was in a office trailer, and the AP was not plugged in and would be turned off. The reason for that is that the staff didn't know what it did. So I hired a networking company to rerun Cat6 cables and to mount the AP away from kids and water. After they have been mounted and run cables. I would then configure them and get them online. </p>

									<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p> Ultimately, I would be able to recognize problems and make it a point to fix them as soon as possible. A few of these simple fixes could make it a lot easier for the employee to do his or her job. It is my goal to help those around me and find solutions to problems that they are facing.  </p>
